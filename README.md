# Car Parking System Using PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)

This project implements an automated car parking system using PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) technology. The system efficiently manages and controls the entry and exit of vehicles in a parking lot.

## Overview

The car parking system automates the process of monitoring parking spaces, and providing real-time information to users.

## Features

- **Parking Space Monitoring**: Sensors detect parking space occupancy and relay information to the PLC.
- **Real-time Display**: LED displays or screens provide real-time updates about available parking spaces.

## Components

1. **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)**: Core control unit managing system operations.
2. **Sensors**: Ultrasonic or infrared sensors detecting vehicle presence in parking spaces.

3. **LED Displays**: Display boards showing real-time parking space availability.
